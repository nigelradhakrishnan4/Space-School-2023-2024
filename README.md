# Space-School
This repository contains the content for the 2023/2024 Space School year.

## Goal
As a whole, the Queen's Space Engineering Team (QSET) is committed to ensuring that the team is accessible to all students, regardless of technical background or experience. The goal of Space School is to provide new members of QSET Satellite with a dedicated team of students to help develop the necessary skills and knowledge to be effective members of the team, bridging the gap to working on the complex satellite subsystems. Through having a devoted team tasked with onboarding and training new members you accomplish giving new members the support they need and you reduce the load of executive members who already have a full plate. If you complete Space School, which encompasses completing the labs in this repository and attending the weekly Space School meetings, you will create a toast satellite (toastSat), named for its toast-like shape. Your toastSat will be launched on a high-altitude balloon in the winter semester. The skills gained here are the basis for what you will need to know when you are working on our 3U cube satellite. üõ∞Ô∏è


Please note that you require **NO PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE** and we are here to support you on your entire toastSat building journey. 

## Skills Gained
By the end of Space School, you will gain experience in the following areas:

- Technical skills
  - LAUNCHING SOMETHING INTO THE STRATOSPHERE :rocket:
  - Coding in C/C++/Arduino
  - Arduino hardware
  - CAD Modelling
  - Soldering
  - PCB Design
  - Experience using microcontrollers
  - Experience developing basic circuits
  - Working within design constraints
  - developing system budgets (mass/power/data/ etc.)
  - Team-based skills
  - Understanding of the satellite subsystems
  - Intro to space engineering
  - Get to know all the amazing people we have on the team üôÇ

## Content Overview
The week numbers correspond to the weeks of the school semester.

**Semester One - Fall** 
- Week 3: Meet Space School members and introduce Arduino.
- Week 4, Lab 1: Blinky LED
- Week 5, Lab 2: TMP 36 Sensor
- Fall Reading Week.
- Week 6, Lab 3: SD Card Reader

- The remainder of the semester will be spent integrating all members onto a sub-team of their choice.

## Space School History
Many years ago in 2019 Emma Paczkowski and Sydney Caulfeild had just finished their first year on QSET as a first year. Although they had spent a whole year on the team they did not accomplish much as they had hoped and they were sad to see the 50 first-year students that started in September diminish to only 4 at the end of the year. To help both the experience of new members on the team as well as to increase retention the idea of Space School was born.  Over the 3 years it has run the structure has changed and improved.  This can be attributed to the wonderful additions of Thomas Seans (the space expert, team mentor, and phenomenal presenter), Sean Tedesco (incredible lab writer responsible and the former CTO), and Piper Steffen (2021/2022 space school organizer). We hope that space school will remain an accessible option for new members looking to bridge the gap between their knowledge and the complex subsystem projects!
